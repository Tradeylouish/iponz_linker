# IPONZ Linker
This browser extension is a utility for creating permanent links to searches on the IPONZ patent, design, and trade mark registers.

## Installation
You can install this extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/iponz-linker/ekoaiaoikoakfaddefogbojeokkehngk) (which also works for Microsoft Edge) or from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/iponz-linker/) (which also works on Firefox for Android). 

Alternatively, you can install it from source:
1. Run ```git clone https://github.com/Tradeylouish/iponz_linker```
2. Open Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, go to "Manage Extensions" and turn Developer Mode on
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the cloned repository

## Linking
The links generated by this extension are simply the URL of the [GitHub Pages site](https://iponz.link) with a query string appended that includes all the parameters of the search to be executed. Links are generated by clicking on the extension icon while viewing any of the IPONZ registers.

You can generate a link while viewing an individual record, or while on the search page. On the search page, any values you have entered into the text-based search fields will automatically be extracted and placed into the link. The link will also be copied to your clipboard.

Here are examples of links to individual records on the patent, design, and trade mark registers respectively: 
* https://iponz.link?register=pt&number=519157
* https://iponz.link?register=ds&number=433816
* https://iponz.link?register=tm&number=1263964

Here are examples of links that represent a search using multiple fields:
* https://iponz.link?register=pt&filingDateFrom=2025-01-01&inventor=Smith
* https://iponz.link?register=ds&locarno=06.01&registrationDateFrom=2025-01-01
* https://iponz.link?register=tm&title=shirt&specification=clothing

With this extension installed, following a link in this format will redirect you to the right register and automatically run a search using the data in the link. 

Currently, non-text fields like drop-downs and checkboxes are not supported, but may be added in a future version.
